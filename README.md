# Developer Tours Website

> Test-Project

This is a test-project for personal learning. I decided to go with Vue.js because it's an extremely simple to learn reactive Framework to build SPAs with. I wanted to try the new Version 3 in a practical project and it made a perfect fit as there were no 3rd party plugins needed to fulfill the requirements of this project.

## Installing / Getting started

```shell
$ npm install
# OR
$ yarn

This installs the required node_modules.

Then run
